# Identifying-phishing-theme-using-Unsupervised-machine-learning-techniques
Phishing emails are a type of online scam where criminals send an email that appears to be from a legitimate company and ask you to provide sensitive information. This is usually done by including a link that will appear to take you to the company’s website to fill in your information – but the website is a clever fake and the information you provide goes straight to the person behind the scam.  In this research paper, unsupervised machine learning and the K-means Clustering technique is applied to identify the theme of phishing on a phishing-email dataset which is scraped from various sources spanning from 2010 till 2019.  Unsupervised machine learning uncovers previously unknown patterns in data and is best applied when there is no data on desired outcomes or for problems that the business has not seen before.  K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points together based on certain similarities to discover underlying patterns.  This research paper will explain: The purpose of the study The analysis of the data set The process of cleaning the data Identification of a phishing theme using clustering Our conclusions
